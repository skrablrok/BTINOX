                <h1>PASTEURIZATION</h1>
                <p id="paster_1">Infections and microbial contamination that occur during the production process are often detected only with a delay. This risk can be avoided by using the pasteurization process.</p>  
                <p id="paster_2">The recuperative design of the continuous flow pasteurization system enables the recovery of up to 96% of the supplied heat, making this process one of the most cost-effective heat treatment methods in use today.</p>
                <details class="readmore">
                    <summary>

                    </summary>
                    <p id="paster_3">Microbiologically unstable products that are packaged and delivered to the customer can represent a serious challenge for the manufacturer. Infections and microbial contamination that occur during the production process are often detected only after a certain time delay. This risk can be effectively avoided with the pasteurization process.</p>  
                    <p id="paster_4">The most reliable way to maintain stable quality and full product flavor is pasteurization or continuous flow pasteurization. Through thermal inactivation of microorganisms, the manufacturer defines the microbiological properties of the product. As with all methods of reducing the presence of microorganisms, effectiveness depends on the initial number of organisms in the untreated beverage. The effectiveness of the heat treatment is measured by the number of achieved pasteurization units (PU).</p>  
                    <p id="paster_5">In a flow pasteurizer, the product is continuously subjected to gentle treatment just before packaging. Microorganisms that could spoil the beverage are quickly destroyed without affecting its quality. This process allows manufacturers to ensure consistent quality of their products.</p>  
                    <p id="paster_6">Flow pasteurization is a reliable and economical method that ensures top-quality results. We place special emphasis on process safety, enabling the production of the highest-quality products. Our design considers all key parameters to prevent any change in taste or color of the product.</p>  
                    <p id="paster_7">Our pasteurization unit demonstrates high efficiency. Thanks to the recuperative design of the flow pasteurization system, up to 96 percent of the supplied heat can sometimes be recovered. This is why flow pasteurization is currently the most cost-effective of all thermal processing methods in use today.</p>  
                    <p id="paster_8">The design and operation of the system must be specifically adapted to the type of product being processed. Through long-term planning, we focus on hygienically flawless, high-quality process modules and components that ensure maximum long-term reliability.</p>

                <h1>CIP CLEANING UNIT</h1>
                <p id="ciscenje_cip_1">The design and functionality of the CIP unit have a significant impact on operating costs and hygiene standards. Proper layout ensures cleaning efficiency, thereby guaranteeing production safety and the quality of the final product.</p>
                <p id="ciscenje_cip_2">The appropriate system configuration is determined by the cost of detergents, water consumption, media availability, and the production processes themselves. Installing systems tailored to specific operational areas provides additional safety.</p>

                    <p id="ciscenje_cip_3">Automatic CIP systems often receive less attention than main processes, yet proper design and functionality significantly impact operating costs and hygiene standards. Correct layout ensures cleaning efficiency, safe production, and product quality. The appropriate system configuration is determined by detergent costs, water consumption, media availability, and the production processes themselves.</p>
                    <p id="ciscenje_cip_4">The most important factors in plant decision-making are high plant yields, optimal vessel occupancy times, and minimal primary energy consumption. Our CIP cleaning concept uses special mixing safety valves for the safe separation of vessel and pipe groups. This allows independent cleaning of vessels and pipes, even if production in other departments or systems in the plant continues uninterrupted.</p>
                    <p id="ciscenje_cip_5">We ensure product safety at every stage of the process. We consider all local conditions, specific customer requirements, and pathways to significant savings.</p>
